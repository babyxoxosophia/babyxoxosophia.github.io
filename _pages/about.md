Sophia cannot be contained in a box. As an actor, model, TV host, and a multi-talented personality, she transcends labels and expectations. Through her modelling, she communicates her passions for fitness, nature, international cusines, and support for her local communities and small businesses looking to publicise.

Sophia believes that fitness is essential for both physical and mental wellbeing. She maintains an active lifestyle and healthy diet. She is also an advocate for environmental causes and sustainability, specifically reducing single-use plastics and encouraging more sustainable fashion.

Beyond her career, Sophia is deeply devoted to promoting local businesses, artists, and causes in her community. She uses her social media platforms to help highlight their work and raise awareness of the many talented entrepreneurs in her city. She also participates in and hosts events that bring people together around shared interests like yoga, farmers markets, and live music.
