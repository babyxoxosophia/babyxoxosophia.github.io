I was invited to represent Anaganaga O Prema Katha at its official press meet, engaging with media and fans during the film’s launch. As part of the core cast, I spoke about the creative journey behind the project and shared insights into my role, helping generate buzz ahead of its release. This public-facing engagement strengthened the film’s promotional campaign and highlighted my experience with high-visibility media events.
